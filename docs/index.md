## Introduction

Trading strategy for the [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io) crypto bot. For backtesting results, check out the comments in the individual [commit](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity/commits/main) page.

## General Recommendations

For optimal performance, suggested to use between 4 and 6 open trades, with unlimited stake.

A pairlist with 40 to 80 pairs. Volume pairlist works well.

Prefer stable coin (USDT, USDC etc) pairs, instead of BTC or ETH pairs.

Highly recommended to blacklist leveraged tokens (*BULL, *BEAR, *UP, *DOWN etc).

Ensure that you don't override any variables in you config.json. Especially the timeframe (must be 5m).

- `use_exit_signal` must set to true (or not set at all).
- `exit_profit_only` must set to false (or not set at all).
- `ignore_roi_if_entry_signal` must set to true (or not set at all).
